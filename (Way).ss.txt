"I am the Way, the Truth and the Life". (Jn 14:6) [7]

"The Church gives us not a system, but a key; not a plan of God's City, but the means of entering it. Perhaps someone will lose his way because he has no plan. But all that he will see, he will see without a mediator, he will see it directly, it will be real for him; while he who has studied only the plan risks remaning outside and not really finding anything." (Fr Georges Florovsky) [7]

"Unknown and yet well known." (2 Corinthians 6:9) (11)

"God cannot be grasped by the mind. If he could be grasped, he would not be God." (Evagrius of Pontus) (11)

"One day some of the brethren came to see Abba Antony, and among them was Abba Joseph. Wishing to test them, the old man mentioned a text from Scripture, and starting with the youngest he asked what it meant. Each explained it as best he could. But to each one the old man said, "You have not yet found the answer." Last of all he said to Abba Joseph, "And what do you think the text means?" He replied, "I do not know." Then Abba Antony said, "Truly, Abba Joseph has found the way, for he said: I do not know."" (The Sayings of the Desert Fathers) (11)

"As a friend talking with his friend, man speaks with God, and drawing near in confidence he stands before the face of the One who dwells in light unapproachable." (St Symeon the New Theologian) (11)

"Imagine a sheer, steep crag, with a projecting edge at the top. Now imagine what a person would probably feel if he put his foot on the edge of the precipice and, looking down into the chasm below, saw no solid footing nor anything to hold on to. This is what I think the soul experiences when it goes beyond its footing in material things, in its quest for that which has no dimension and which exists for all eternity. For here there is nothing it can take hold of, neither place nor time, neither measure nor anything else; our minds cannot approach it. And thus the soul, slipping at every point from what cannot be grasped, becomes dizzy and perplexed and returns once again to what is connatural to it, content now to know merely this about the Transcendent, that it is completely different from the nature of the things that the soul knows." (St. Gregory of Nyssa) (24)

"Think of a man standing at night inside his house, with all the doors closed; and then suppose that he opens a window just at the moment there is a sudden flash of lightning. (... to be continued ... 24)"

Divine and Uncreated Light of Tabor
Council of Constantinople 1341
Council of Constantinople 1351

Body is not an enemy.
Christ took human flesh and saved the WP.

(---------------)
Doctrine of the Human Person (Palamas)
--------------------------------------
- Allowed for the use of bodily exercises in prayer
- Hesychasts did experience the Divine and Uncreated Light of Tabor

Distinction between the essence and the energies of God.

GP set Hesychasm on a firm dogmatic basis.

Teaching confirmed at councils of Constantinople 1341, 1351

The human being is a single, united whole; not only the human mind but the /whole/ person was created in the image of God.

Our body is not an enemy, but partner and collaborator with our soul.

Christ, by taking a body at the Incarnation, has "made the /flesh/ an inexhaustible source of sanctification."

Gregory applied the doctrine of the person to the Hesychast methods of prayer.

By placing such emphasis on the role of the body in prayer, Gregory argued, Hesychasts are not guilty of a gross materialism but are simply remaining faithful to the Biblical doctrine of personhood as a unity.

Christ took human flesh and saved the whole person.

Therefore it is the /whole/ person - body and soul together - that prays to God.

Affirmation 1: We humans know God.
Affirmation 2: God is by nature unknowable.

Transfiguration

St. Gregory Palamas (1296-1359)
