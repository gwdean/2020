Preface to First Edition
------------------------
Category theory provides a convenient conceptual language:
  - Category
  - Functor
  - Natural Transformation
  - Contravariance
  - Functor Category

Adjoint Pair of Functors ("fundamental idea")
  - Universal Construction
  - Direct Limit
  - Inverse Limit
  - Pairs of Functors with a Natural Isomorphism between Corresponding Sets of Arrows

"Adjoint functors arise everywhere."

Monoid -> a set with a binary operation of multiplication that is associative and that has a unit

A category can be considered a sort of generalized monoid.

Categories with a monoidal structure (given by a tensor product) lead inter alia to study of more convenient categories of topological spaces.

Learn to live without elements;
Use arrows instead.

All concepts of category theory are Kan extensions.

The (homo)-morphisms of an algebraic system can also be described by diagrams.

Introduction (1-5)
------------------
Category theory starts with the observation that many properties of mathematical systems can be unified and simplified by a presentation with diagrams and arrows. 

Many properties of mathematical constructions may be represented by universal properties of diagrams.

Adjointness is another expression for these universal properties.

The construction "cartesian product" is called a "functor" because it applies suitably to sets /and/ to the functions between them.

The notion of a monoid (a semigroup with identity) plays a central role in category theory.

Preface
-------
Quantum mechanics is a beautiful generalization of the laws of probability: a generalization based on the 2-norm rather than the 1-norm, and on complex numbers rather than nonnegative real numbers. (xvii)

Math/Logic vs. Physics (xviii-xix)

QT of Computation -> merger of QM + CCT (xix)

Past is indeterminate... (xx)

Dialogue between the Intellect and the Senses
  - Intellect: By convention there is sweetness, by convention bitterness, by convention color, in reality only atoms and the void.
  - Senses: Foolish intellect! Do you seek to overthrow us, while it is from us that you take your evidence? (xviii)

Summary from Preface (xx-xxii)
------------------------------

Atoms and the void
------------------
"I would rather discover a single cause than become king of the Persians." - Democritus

How did we ever come to believe in this theory that seems so uncomfortable with the fact of our own existence? (4)

- Copenhagen/Bayesian/Epistemic etc.
- Many Worlds, Bohmian Mechanics etc.

We can conceive of experiments that would differentiate the first type of interpretation from the second type. (5)

Philosophical Janitor vs. Philosophical Scout (6)

In quantum computing, the sorts of things that we like to calculate -- capacities of quantum channels, error probabilities of quantum algorithms -- are things people would never have /thought/ to calculate if not for philosophy. 

Sets
----
- Rules of First-Order Logic
- Peano Axioms for the Nonnegative Integers
- Axioms of Set Theory

Rules of First-Order Logic (9)
- Propositional tautologies
- Modus ponens
- Equality rules
- Change of variables
- Quantifier elimination
- Quantifier addition
- Quantifier rules

Peano Axioms for the Nonnegative Integers (9)
- Zero exists
- Every integer has at most one predecessor

Axioms of Set Theory (11)
- Empty set
- Extensionality
- Pairing
- Union
- Existence of infinite sets
- Power set
- Replacement
- Foundation

The nonnegative integers are called a /model/ for the axioms. (9)

In logic, the word "model" just means any collection of objects and functions of those objects that satisfies the axioms. (9)

Treating proofs as mathematical objects opens the way toward metamathematics. (10)

Cantor's Proof -> one of the four or five greatest proofs in all of math. (13)

Continuum hypothesis/Axiom of choice (14-15)

Teaching Quantum Mechanics: The Second Way (Aaronson-2018 ch-9)
===============================================================
The second way to teach quantum mechanics starts directly from the "conceptual core"

Conceptual Core -> a certain generalization of the laws of probability to allow minus signs (and more generally, complex numbers).
