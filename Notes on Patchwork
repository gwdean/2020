A Positive Vision
-----------------
Patchwork -> the Mencist vision of a political system for the 21st century.

["At the risk of being accused of a sales job, I will paint Patchwork in warm, glowing, Obamatronic pastels, rather than our usual chilly, Machiavellian cynicism."]

If anyone can build anything like Patchwork, even a tiny, crude, Third World ripoff of Patchwork, it is all over for the Democratic Regimes. 

Children growing up in the patchwork era will learn a new name and a new history of the democratic past.

Dutch invasion of England (1688) ended the span of legitimate continuity in English government that began with William the Conqueror, replacing it with eternal, degenerate Whiggery and the quisling, "constitutional" or ceremonial Hanover princes.

It will be called something "cool", like the Anglo-American Interregnum.

AAI (which we are still in) -> a period of global monotonic decline in official authority.

Declining official authority, declining personal morality, and increasing bureaucracy are observed in synchrony.

The combination is an infallible symptom of the great terminal disease of the polity - leftism. 

Leftism is cancer.

On theoretical grounds alone, the only cure for leftism is complete and permanent excision.

Success implies complete absence of the organism from the body politic.

This does not mean there are no leftists in the country; in a well governed country which is at peace, people can think or say whatever they please.

It just means that if there are for some reason leftists, their views are completely without influence on government policy.

So people laugh at them and call them names.

A world without Leftism? Imagine! (Lennon/Lenin)

Acceptance of this goal (which MM thinks Patchwork can achieve) is the difference between a conservative and a reactionary.

Basic Goal of UR -> convince people who are progressives to abandon their delusions.

Basic Idea of Patchwork -> as the crappy governments we inherited from history are smashed, they should be replaced by a global spiderweb of tens, even hundreds, of thousands of soverign and independent mini-countries, each governed by its own joint-stock corporation without regard to the residents' opinions. If residents don't like their government, they can and should move. The design is all "exit", no "voice".

Essential Inspiration for Patchwork -> the observation that the periods in which human civilization has flowered are the periods in which it has been most politically divided.

Burkhardt -> Europe was safe so long as she was not unified, and now that she is we can see exactly what he meant.

Small is good.
Local is good.
Different is good.

How did all these Obamaniacs, these young hip progressives, convince themselves that when it comes to government, bigger is better?

That we need a World Government?

That international public opinion is all that really matters in the world, that America should lead the world, feed the world, and be governed by the world?

The issues that matter to them tend to be transnational. As big as possible.

We are done with the present system of government. We want a reboot.

We need a new operating system.

We can think of Patchwork as a new operating system for the world.

A /patchwork/ is any network consisting of a large number of small but independent states.

PATCH -> each state's real estate

REALM -> the sovereign corporate owner (i.e the government) of the PATCH.

Anything like a patchwork needs a strong security design. (We don't want to end up back at Liberal Democracy after all!)

To be a reactionary is to borrow freely across time as well as space, incorporating political designs and experience from wherever and whenever.

Patchwork is something NEW. It will not feel like the past.

The democratic past will feel increasingly gray, weird, scary.

[MM describes a clean city that he would love to live in.]

Under Patchwork, there would be no such thing as an "unsafe neighborhood".

Progressivism is not the cure-all for all ills but the eternal poisonous chameleon.

"Anatomy of Patchwork" (begins on pg. 6)

How will Patchwork actually be governed?

The entire problem can be described as one of SECURITY.

Axioms of Patchwork's Philosophy of Security
--------------------------------------------
1. Security is a monotonic desideratum.
2. Security and liberty do not conflict.
3. Security and complexity are opposites.
