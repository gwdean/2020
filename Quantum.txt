Some notes on Quantum Mechnanics, Cryptography and Computing
============================================================
QBism (von Baeyer-2016)
-----------------------
1. Quantum Mechanics
2. Probability
3. Quantum Bayesianism
4. QBist Worldview

*Quantum Probabilities* are numerical measures of personal degrees of belief. (Principal Thesis of QBism)

*QBism* is based on personalistic/subjective Bayesianism.

Probability, in this view, is not out there in the real world, but places it instead in the mind of a person. (agent)
