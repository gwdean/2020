- Law is not some abstract entity, existing in an ideal sphere of Justice with a capital "J". (189)
- It is a form of social behavior which we can observe and measure. (189)

Preface (xv-xvi)
----------------
1. This book contains a number of propositions about the variation of law across social space.
1. The purpose of these propositions is to predict and explain this variation, and so contribute to a scientific theory of law.
1. Theory of this kind has practical applications, and also applications to the study of other social life. 
1. This book does not judge the variation of law, nor does it recommend a policy of any kind.
1. It is merely an effort to understand law as a natural phenomenon.
1. The theory of law is an an example, and not the ultimate concern, of this work.

Theoretical Strategy -> assumes that *social life* is a subject matter in its own right, apart from individuals as such.

Introduction (1-10)
-------------------
1. Behavior is the variable aspect of reality.
1. Everything behaves, living or not, whether molecules, organisms, planets, or personalities.
1. This applies to social life as well, to families, organizations, cities and so on ...
(... continue ...)

1. Stratification -> uneven distribution of conditions of existence (vertical aspect of social life)
2. Morphology     -> distribution of people in relation to each other (horizontal aspect of social life)
3. Culture        -> religion, decoration, folklore, etc. (the symbolic aspect of social life)
4. Organiztion    -> capacity for collective action. (the corporate aspect of social life)
5. Social Control -> the definition of deviant behavior and the response to it (normative aspect of social life)

Stratification -> Vertical
Morphology     -> Horizontal
Culture        -> Symbolic
Organization   -> Corporate
Social Control -> Normative

Aspects the social environment -> Vertical, Horizontal, Symbolic, Corporate, Normative

Foreword (Cooney) (xi-xiii)
---------------------------
1. Black proposes that legal behavior -- in every society, at every time -- can be explained by the social characteristics of the parties, or, more abstractly, by its location and direction in social space (later known as its "social geometry").

1. The book contains the only general sociological theory of law.

1. No other theory sets out a body of testable propositions predicting and explaining what legal actors actually do -- call the police, make arrests, hand down indictments, file charges, pass judgement, and impose sentences or award damages of varying magnitudes.

1. Testable statements are crucial because only they allow us to discover and discard false ideas and allow knowledge to grow and progress. 

1. Black's theory has progressed.

1. In later work, he extended the theory in several directions, incorporating third parties (lawyers, witnesses, judges, and jurors), suggesting innovative ways to equalize outcomes across cases, showing how lawyers can use his theory to win cases, and discussing his profound discover that "the law" (of homicide, contract, or anything else) does not exist, but varies geometrically, from case to case.

1. The book consists of precise definitions, lucid presentations of evidence, lucid presentations of evidence, exact citations, and most important, sharp, testable propositions. 

1. The world of *The Behavior of Law* is bigger, brighter, more intelligible ... like standing at the top of a mountain and gazing down at the valley in which one has lived one's entire life, seeing for the first time all its myriad details and how they combine into a splendid whole.

1. *The Behavior of Law* introduces a new system of thought, a theoretical paradigm capable of being applied far beyond law, to any and all social behavior.

Pure Sociology
- "Pure" because it explains social life without invoking psychology.
- "Pure" because it eschews ... individual or group purposes.
- "Pure" because it posits that social life behaves, not people.

1. Law, for instance, behaves through the actions of litigants and lawyers, police officers and witnesses, and judges and jurors.

1. Every form of social life behaves -- war, travel, sex, religion, laughter, money, sport, conversation, music, etc -- and the task of pure sociology is to discover the principles according to which it does.

1. By removing the three P's (psychology, purposes, and people), Black has devised a paradigm that can range more widely, employ fewer concepts, and explain more facts.
